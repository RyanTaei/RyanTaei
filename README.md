## Blackfoot paua translocation November 2023 Warrington (Okahau)
Team members: Ryan Taei, Dion Watts, Dominic Hayes, Huw Jenner

There are three versions of paua translocation. This is the version from Warrington Point, while the others are from Puketeraki and Waikouati River Mouth. 

This involved the transfer of 120 Black-foot paua (Haliotis iris) from Warrington Point to Huriawa Pa Butterfly bay located in the Karitane Taiapure, Otago New Zealand. before translocation occurred, a population density and substrate profile survey were implemented to asses the existing population by measuring the lengths of paua along a 30 meter transect line using a random number generator to choose the placement of 10 1m^2 quadrats. Paua translocated the following day were measured using the same variables and categorised for differing release methods

# Release methods
Two released methods were used in this study. 
|Code  |Meaning|
|------|-------|
|H1,2,3,4...| Hard releaase|
|S1,2,3,4...| Soft release|

- Hard release involved placing paua onto the rocks within our patch
- Soft release involved creating a bull kelp bag (poha) by cutting the kelp open and placing 20 paua inside. Then placed in between rocks to prevent drifting
